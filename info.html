<!-- The `checkWinner` function you've written executes sequentially, meaning it follows each step in the order they are written. Let me break down what happens step by step:

1. **Looping Through Winning Patterns**:
   - The `for (let pattern of winPatterns)` loop starts by iterating through each winning pattern in the `winPatterns` array.
   - For each pattern (like `[0, 1, 2]`, `[3, 4, 5]`, etc.), the following steps occur:

2. **Printing the Current Pattern Indices**:
   - `console.log(pattern[0], pattern[1], pattern[2]);` prints the indices of the current pattern being checked (e.g., `0 1 2`).

3. **Printing Box Elements**:
   - `console.log(boxes[pattern[0]], boxes[pattern[1]], boxes[pattern[2]]);` prints the DOM elements corresponding to these indices.

4. **Printing the Inner Text of the Current Pattern**:
   - `console.log(boxes[pattern[0]].innerText, boxes[pattern[1]].innerText, boxes[pattern[2]].innerText);` prints the inner text of the boxes at these indices (e.g., the "X" or "O" inside these boxes).

5. **Assigning Values to Variables**:
   - `let pos1Val = boxes[pattern[0]].innerText;`
   - `let pos2Val = boxes[pattern[1]].innerText;`
   - `let pos3Val = boxes[pattern[2]].innerText;`
   - These lines assign the inner text of the boxes at the indices to the variables `pos1Val`, `pos2Val`, and `pos3Val`.

6. **Checking for a Winner**:
   - The `if` statement checks if all three positions (`pos1Val`, `pos2Val`, `pos3Val`) are not empty and are the same. If true, it means a winning combination has been found.

7. **Printing the Winner**:
   - If a winning combination is found, `console.log("winner", pos1Val);` prints the winner (either "X" or "O").
   - The `showWinner(pos1Val);` function is then called to handle the winner display.

### Clarification: Does it Print All Patterns at Once?
No, it does not print all the winning patterns at once. Here’s how it works:

- The function checks each pattern one by one.
- For each pattern, it first prints the indices (`pattern[0], pattern[1], pattern[2]`).
- Then, it prints the inner text of the boxes at those indices.
- After printing, it assigns the inner text values to `pos1Val`, `pos2Val`, and `pos3Val`.
- Finally, it checks if all three positions contain the same value and prints the winner if they do.

### Order of Execution (Simplified):
1. **Print pattern indices**.
2. **Print corresponding box elements**.
3. **Print the inner text of those boxes**.
4. **Assign inner text to variables**.
5. **Check if there’s a winner**.
6. **If there’s a winner, print it**.

Each of these steps happens one at a time for each pattern in the `winPatterns` array. -->



<!-- You're correct in observing that when you click on a box, all the winning patterns are printed, even though only one box is clicked. Let me clarify what's happening: -->

<!-- Why All Winning Patterns Are Printed:
The checkWinner function is designed to check all possible winning combinations (patterns) every time a box is clicked.
When you click on a box, the checkWinner function loops through every pattern in the winPatterns array to determine if any of those patterns have been met.
As part of this process, the function prints out the details for each pattern, which is why you see all patterns being logged, not just the one related to the box you clicked.
Detailed Explanation of Execution:
Click Event: When you click on any box, the click event listener triggers the checkWinner function. -->

<!-- Loop Through Patterns:

The function iterates over every possible winning pattern stored in winPatterns.
For each pattern (like [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], etc.), it prints the current pattern's indices, the corresponding box elements, and their inner text.
Check Each Pattern:

The function checks whether the boxes in the current pattern contain the same non-empty value (either all "X" or all "O").
This is done for every pattern, regardless of which box was clicked.
Result: -->
<!-- 
Even though you clicked on just one box, the function checks all patterns to ensure no winning combination is missed. Therefore, it prints information about every possible pattern.
In Summary:
The function is doing exactly what it's designed to do: check every potential winning combination every time a box is clicked.
The logging (console.log) statements inside the loop make it appear as though all patterns are being processed simultaneously, but in reality, they are being processed one by one in sequence, every time the function is called.
If You Want to See Only Relevant Outputs:
If you only want to print the patterns that have a potential winner (where all three positions are filled), you can modify the logging to only occur inside the if statement that checks for a winner. -->
